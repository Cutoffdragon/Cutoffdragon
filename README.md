## About Me
Greetings, and thank you taking the time to view my portfolio! I am Jason LaGrasse, born on Long Island, New York, with a degree in political science and history from the University of South Carolina.

With a fervent passion for innovative technological solutions, I aim to become a renowned website developer, and eventually breach the skillset required to become a software engineer. My greatest aspiration is to contribute to the development of artificial intelligence and define the next generation of website development.
